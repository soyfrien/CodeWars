# CodeWars

I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ0F9XanCrE) by Ardalis on how to use ChatGPT for pair-programming Kata, and not knowing what any of that was (or recognizing the irony) tried it and thought it was all great. This led to CodeWars.com which seems to be another Kata option that you can do from any web browser.

If you like it, maybe we can be in the same clan?
